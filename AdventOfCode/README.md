# Advent of Code 2019

I'm planning to do the AoC with C# and unit tests, ideally TDD. There's a lot to set up about the environment, so I plan to do that incrementally. For the first day, I'll just get a project started and solve the problem. Then add on from there day by day.

## Day 1 log

 * New project with .NET Core
 * Install Markdown and Github extensions to VS
 * Write solution in Program.cs
 * In the VS properties for day1.txt, set Copy to Output Directory to "Copy if Newer"

## Day 2 log

 * Refactor project into a folder per day

## Day 3 log

 * I was stuck on this one for a while. I think what I have is ugly, but it works.

## Day 5 log

 * After implementing Part 1 by modifying the Day 2 intcode function, I've decided that I've terribly overengineered it and I'm going to start over for part 2, modeled roughly on encse's [excellent implementation](https://github.com/encse/adventofcode/blob/master/2019/Day05/Solution.cs).
