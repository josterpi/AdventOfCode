# Advent of Code 2019

I'm planning to do the AoC with C# and unit tests, ideally TDD. There's a lot to set up about the environment, so I plan to do that incrementally. For the first day, I'll just get a project started and solve the problem. Then add on from there day by day.

## Day 1 log

 * New project with .NET Core
 * Install Markdown and Github extensions to VS
 * Write solution in Program.cs
 * In the VS properties for day1.txt, set Copy to Output Directory to "Copy if Newer"
