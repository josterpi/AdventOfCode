# Advent of Code 2020

Last year was my first year doing AoC and I was hoping to use it as a
chance to get sharper with C#, but it turns out that life is busy and
the puzzles were actually taking more time than I had. This year, I'm
hoping to make more progress with AoC using the language I know best,
Python, and just focus on the puzzles.

Rather than start a new repository for this year, I'm archiving 2019
under year2019.
